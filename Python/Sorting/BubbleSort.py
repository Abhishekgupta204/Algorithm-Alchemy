Approach
∙ Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
∙ The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
∙ This algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity since we have nested loops iterating through the list.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, hence no extra space is required.

# Sample input
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", bubble_sort(arr))

#Sample Output:
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
